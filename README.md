# Example React Native app for AT Protocol

This app demonstrates how to set up a React Native project that can use the [@atproto/api](https://npm.im/@atproto/api).

Due to some differences between the RN environment and most others, there are a number of polyfills that are required. See `fetch-polyfill.ts` and `platform-polyfills.ts` for more info.
